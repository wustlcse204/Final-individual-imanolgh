Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to review my final project that I created for my Web Development course I took at Washington University in St. Louis.
In the repository you will find 3 files, one with HTML code, another with CSS code, and a third with Javascript code.
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that could display the standings and top goal-scorers of Europe's top 5 soccer leagues: 
Spanish, English, Italian, German, and French.  To access these standings and goal-scorer rankings, simply click on the league you would like to view in the header.
The webpage, and specifically the javascript file, interacted with this api to get the live standings and and top goal-scorer rankings: https://www.football-data.org/
Additonally, I added a dark-mode button which changes the layout of the page to black while changing the text to white.
After clicking on the dark-mode button, you can click it again to change the layout of the page to normal-mode which will revert the page to its original colors.
